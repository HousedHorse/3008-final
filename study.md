# Usable Security

## Why Usability Affects Security

- secondary task
    - users focus on their primary task
    - ignore security, or actively sabotage it

- weakest link property
    - the user is the weakest link
    - only takes one hole for a breach

- active adversaries

- barn door property
    - if an attacker gets in, it's GG

## Guidelines for Good Security UI

1. aware of tasks
1. how to perform tasks
1. no dangerous errors
1. comfortable
1. can tell task complete
1. can determine systems state

## Three Types of Authentication Mechanisms

1. Something you have -> 2FA
1. Something you know -> password
1. Something you are  -> fingerprint

## Password Space

- amount of possible unique passwords for a password scheme
- alphabet^length

# Memory and Graphical Passwords

## Memory

- sensory memory
    - buffers (iconic, echoic, haptic)
    - filtering into short term memory by attention
- working memory
    - 70ms access, 200ms decay
    - 7 +/- 2 things at once
    - chunking can help with this
- long term memory
    - 100ms access, little decay
    - very large

- 7 +/- 2 rule for working memory

- expertise and context

- recognition > recall

- primacy and recency
    - first and last things are easier to remember

- best practice?
    - don't overload user memory (7 +/- 2)
    - recognition over recall
    - multiple ways of encoding info (like colored piano keys)

## Graphical Passwords

<!-- doesn't seem to be important -->
<!-- sana said it's better to know big picture stuff for this? follow up on that -->

- how was it designed?

- how data is analyzed and presented













# Quantitative Data and Analysis

## What to Collect?

## Messy Data Collection

- solution: pre-processing
- be careful and include sanity checks
- check data manually as well

## Descriptive Statistics

- mean
- SD
- quartiles and whiskers
    - min
    - max
    - lower
    - middle
    - upper

## Why Do We Need Stats?

## Type I and Type II Errors

- boy who cried wolf
- type  I: think effect exists when it doesn't
- type II: think effect does not exist when it does
- 95% CI is good (5% chance for type I or II error, p-value <= 0.05)
